This project predicts extreme heat events using a CNNâ€“LSTM model in TensorFlow.  
It uses spatiotemporal environmental data and calculates a vulnerability index by linking heat forecasts with social exposure and sensitivity.  
Synthetic data is included for demonstration, but the pipeline is designed for real climate datasets.
